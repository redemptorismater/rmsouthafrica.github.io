				The Redemptoris Mater seminaries are diocesan and missionary seminaries for the “New Evangelisation”, erected by the Diocesan Bishops in agreement with the International Responsible Team of the Neocatechumenal Way. The first Redemptoris Mater Seminary was erected in Rome in 1987, because of the desire Saint John Paul II had to form priests who would support the missionary action of the Church.
				The name of these seminaries comes from the encyclical letter of Saint John Paul II “Redemptoris Mater” (Mother of the Redeemer), promulgated on the 25th of March 1987, just before the erection of the first Seminary. The Virgin Mary is therefore the first Patroness of these seminaries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Redemptoris Mater seminaries were born to receive the vocations awakened by the Holy Spirit in the Neocatechumenal communities. The Neocatechumenal Way, born in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, is a gift of the Holy Spirit for the Church. An instrument in the parishes, at the service of the Diocesan Bishop. It is an itinerary of faith that rebuilds the Christian community by means of a post-baptisimal catechumenate, which brings the community to an adult faith and an intimacy with Jesus Christ.

				 Such a community is called to be a sign of hope for the world, showing signs of love and unity in the dimension of the cross: “Love one another as I have loved you. From this they will know that you are my disciples” (John 13, 34-35), “Father, I in them and You in me, so that they may be perfectly one and the world may know that you have sent me” (John 17,23). This experience, initiated by Kiko Argüello and Carmen Hernàndez in the 1960s in the shacks of “Palomeras Altas” on the edge of Madrid, has brought many fruits along the years – the Redemptoris Mater seminaries being one of them. The experience of the Neocatechumenal Way accompanies the seminarians during the time of their formation, as well as the Priests during their ministry. Every seminarian or priest is part of a community, in which he follows an itinerary of Christian formation together with other brothers and sisters.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Redemptoris Mater seminaries “the candidates for the priesthood find in participation in the Neocatechumenal Way, a specific and basic element of their formative itinerary and, at the same time, are prepared for a “genuine presbyteral choice of service to the entire people of God in the fraternal communion of the presbyterate”.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Archbishop of Cape Town, Stephen Brislin, on the day in which the statutes were signed in the Basilica of St. Peter, commented on the birth of the seminary as follows.
				<blockquote>
					[…] the principal characteristic of the Redemptoris Mater – which has been a prophetic intuition of the initiator Kiko Arguello – is that it is not presupposed that the candidates to priesthood have faith, since the families of origin have not always transmitted to them a pure faith. Therefore, the principal method of formation is a Christian initiation of the candidates, that runs parallel to the philosophical-theological one. This way of initiation is realised by the Neocatechumenal itinerary in small communities, in which they experience the real presence of Christ through the Word, the Sacraments of the Eucharist and Penance and love for the neighbour. All of this is celebrated weekly, to help each one experience in their own life of the presence of the Risen Christ
				</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Redemptoris Mater seminaries are seminaries for the New Evangelisation, which means that they prepare for a mission in places where there is no presence of the Church, or where the secularisation has weakened the Christian community to a point that a new missionary action is needed. These were the words of Benedict XVI in August of 2012: “The task of the Church is to evangelise, to proclaim the message of salvation to those who don’t know Christ” and to the “baptised ones, whose lives do not reflect the demands of their baptism”. Pope Francis has used similar words in the days before Easter 2013: to follow Jesus means to “learn to go out of ourselves, to go towards the others, to go to the peripheries of existence. We must take the first step towards our brothers and sisters, especially towards those who are the most far away, those who are forgotten, those who are more in need of understanding, consolation and help. There is a great need to bring the living presence of the merciful Jesus, who is rich in love!” This is the zeal that animates the Church, to bring the announcement of the Gospel, the “Good News” of Christ who died and rose for us, so that we may have a new life in him, not living anymore for ourselves but for Christ Jesus! (cfr. 2 Cor. 5,15). The Church was born with this event of Resurrection and with the announcement of the apostles, and it went into the whole world to preach the forgiveness of sins, the victory over all that destroys us and kills us, to testify to eternal life in Jesus Christ. Many families of the Neocatechumenal Way, full of gratitude for the Lord, have offered themselves to help the mission of Church, going to live in the most secularised and de-Christianised areas of the world to bring the Good News of the Risen Christ. This is why the need arose to form new priests to accompany these families in the New Evangelisation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Redemptoris Mater seminaries are diocesan and missionary. Diocesan because they have been erected by the Bishop, and missionary because they form priests who are available to be sent by the Bishop into all parts of the world, according to the needs of the evangelisation: “The spiritual gift which priests receive at their ordination prepared them not for a sort of limited and narrow mission but for the widest possible and universal mission of salvation “even to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8), for every priestly ministry shares in the universality of the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles.”
			</p>
			<p>
				There is in fact no contrast between being diocesan and missionary, but instead a fantastic harmony. The nature of the diocese is to be missionary, because the Church is missionary. And it is the Bishop of a diocese who sends missionaries in other parts of the world, where these missions take place in a particular diocese in communion with its Bishop. As Saint John Paul II said during a meeting in the Redemptoris Mater seminary of Rome: 
				<blockquote>
					“It is necessary to avoid a false choice between pastoral service in the Diocese to which you belong and the universal mission to the ends of the earth which is rooted in sacramental participation in the priesthood of Christ (cf. Pastores Dabo Vobis, nn. 17-18), for which you are specially prepared through the experience of the Neocatechumenal Way. In fact, the decision as to where you are eventually sent is up to the Bishop, who has at heart both the needs of his Diocese and the requirements of the universal mission.”
				</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				During their formation the seminarians have an experience of “itinerancy” of at least two years, being inserted into a team of the Neocatechumenal Way to help in the work of the evangelisation in a given nation. Many years of experience have shown that this experience of itinerancy is a great help for the seminarians in their formation. Besides getting to know a new country and learning a new language, they can really witness the miracles that the Lord does through the “foolishness of the preaching” (1st Letter to the Corinthians of St. Paul apostle) and experience a time of precariousness, just like the apostles trusting only in the Lord (cfr. Mk 6,7-13 and parallels). The time of itinerancy is moreover a privileged moment to confirm one’s own vocation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Redemptoris Mater  seminaries are also international: each seminary is formed of seminarians coming from different continents and countries, as a concrete sign of the catholicity and universality of the Church. Every young man who is preparing himself to enter a seminary offers his availability to be sent to any Redemptoris Mater of the world. It is incredible to see the availability of these young men, ready to go everywhere; it is a true sign of the work of the Holy Spirit in them. Moreover, the internationality of the seminaries broadens the panorama of cultures and languages with which the seminarians have to interact during their formation, which is very important. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At present there are over 100 Redemptoris Mater seminaries in the world; in November 2012, after more than twenty years of the Neocatechumenal Way being present in South Africa, a Redemptoris Mater was erected in Cape Town: after signing the decree, Archbishop Brislin said, “we came here - in Rome – […] to thank the Lord for the gift of this Seminary that comes to bring a hope to our Diocese and to all of Africa”
